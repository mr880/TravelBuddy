The html pages in the main directory are:
	index.html
	choice.html
	food.html
	thingstodo.html
	mapindex.html

index.html is the main page, and the other pages are appropriately titled to their respective sections. mapindex.html was the test page I was going to use for the googlemaps api but I haven't really gotten a chance to do much more than just add a map to it.

The folders on the main directory are all materialize's defaults. 

The assets folder contains the local page specific resources.
